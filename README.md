## Introduction
### Hello world, my name is Ricky and I am a biologist. I decide to step out of my comfort zone to learn coding because I see the bright future of applying computation to assist scientific discoveries. Hopefully, I can learn the basic knowledge of coding in a fair amount of time and apply them to my graduate research.
